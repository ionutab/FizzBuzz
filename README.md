### FizzBuzz

---

## step1
branch: FizzBuzz-step1

_initial implementation_

Write code that produces the following output for each number in a contiguous range of integers:

1. the number itself
2. "fizz" for numbers that are multiples of 3
3. "buzz" for numbers that are multiples of 5
4. "fizzbuzz" for numbers that are multiples of 15

Being careful to avoid trailing spaces.

e.g. running the program with a __range__ from 1-20 should produce the following result:
```
1 2 fizz 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz 13 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzzs
```
Init a local git repository and create a commit with the solution

## step2
branch: FizzBuzz-step2

_alfresco variation_

Please enhance your existing FizzBuzz solution to perform the following:

If the number contains a three you must output the text ‘alfresco’, any other rule is skipped.

e.g. running the program with a range from 1-20 should produce the following result:
```
1 2 alfresco 4 buzz fizz 7 8 fizz buzz 11 fizz alfresco 14 fizzbuzz 16 17 fizz 19 buzz
```

Create a branch for the alfresco variation and then a commit with the solution.
